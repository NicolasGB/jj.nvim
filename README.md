# jj.nvim

⚠️ **WORK IN PROGRESS** ⚠️

A Neovim plugin for [Jujutsu (jj)](https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj) version control system.

## About

This plugin aims to be something like vim-fugitive but for driving the jj-vcs CLI. The goal is to eventually provide features similar to git status, diffs, and pickers for managing Jujutsu repositories directly from Neovim.

![Demo](https://github.com/NicolasGB/jj.nvim/raw/main/assets/demo.gif)

## Current Features

- Basic jj command execution through `:J` command
- Terminal-based output display for jj commands
- Support jj subcommands including your aliases through the cmdline.
- First class citizens with ui integration
  - `describe` - Set change descriptions
  - `status` / `st` - Show repository status
  - `log` - Display log history with configurable options
  - `diff` - Show changes
  - `new` - Create a new change
  - `edit` - Edit a change
  - `squash` - Squash the current diff to it's parent
- Picker for for [Snacks.nvim](https://github.com/folke/snacks.nvim)
  - `jj status` Displays the current changes diffs
  - `jj file_history` Displays a buffer's history changes and allows to edit it's change (including immutable changes)

## Enhanced integrations

Here are some cool features you can do with jj.nvim

### Diff any change

You can diff any change in your log history by simply pressing `d` on it's line, yeah just like that!

## Installation

Using [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim):

```lua
{
  "nicolasgb/jj.nvim",
  config = function()
    require("jj").setup({})
  end,
}
```

## Cmdline Usage

The plugin provides a `:J` command that accepts jj subcommands:

```sh
:J status
:J log
:J describe "Your change description"
:J new
:J # This will use your defined default command
:J <your-alias>
```

## Setup config

```lua
{
  -- Setup snacks as a picker
  picker = {
    -- Here you can pass the options as you would for snacks.
    -- It will be used when using the picker
    snacks = {

    }
  }
}

```

## Example config

```lua
{
  "nicolasgb/jj.nvim",
  config = function()
    require("jj").setup({})
    local cmd = require "jj.cmd"
    vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>jd", cmd.describe, { desc = "JJ describe" })
    vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>jl", cmd.log, { desc = "JJ log" })
    vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>je", cmd.edit, { desc = "JJ edit" })
    vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>jn", cmd.new, { desc = "JJ new" })
    vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>js", cmd.status, { desc = "JJ status" })
    vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>dj", cmd.diff, { desc = "JJ diff" })
    vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>sj", cmd.squash, { desc = "JJ squash" })

    -- Pickers
    vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>gj", function()
        require("jj.picker").status()
    end, { desc = "JJ Picker status" })
    vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>gl", function()
        require("jj.picker").file_history()
    end, { desc = "JJ Picker file history" })



    -- Some functions like `describe` or `log` can take parameters
    vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>jl", function()
      cmd.log {
        revisions = "all()",
      }
    end, { desc = "JJ log" })

    -- This is an alias i use for moving bookmarks its so good
    vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>jt", function()
      cmd.j "tug"
      cmd.log {}
    end, { desc = "JJ tug" })
  end,
}

```

## Requirements

## Contributing

This is an early-stage project. Contributions are welcome, but please be aware that the API and features are likely to change significantly.

## Documentation

Once the plugin is more complete i'll write docs for each of the commands.

## FAQ

- Telescope Suport? Planned but i don't use it, it's already thought of by design, will implement it at some point or if someone submits a PR i'll accept it gladly.
